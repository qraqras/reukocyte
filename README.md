# PreCop

> ⚠️ **This project is currently under development and not ready for production use.**

A fast Ruby Layout formatter written in Rust.

**PreCop** is a high-performance alternative to RuboCop's Layout cops. It focuses exclusively on code formatting, leaving Lint and Style checks to RuboCop.

## Use Cases

- **Pre-commit hooks** without delays
- **Instant format-on-save** in editors
- **Bulk formatting** thousands of files in seconds
- **Parallel CI** with early failure detection
